# CS411-Project


Welcome to ChS:Go, a modified game of chess to make chess more enjoyable! To run the game, simply download the code and run it in eclipse or any IDE. 
In order to play the game, simply make sure all the code is in the same repository and run the PlayGame.java file. This will prompt
the game to start. Capital lettered pieces are white pieces and lower cased letters are black pieces. To play, simply select a piece every round
it is your turn and then select a move for that piece. The game terminates after 200 moves occur, a stalemate occurs or a checkmate occurs.
